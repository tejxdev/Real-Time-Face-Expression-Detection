# ðŸŽ¯ Real-Time Face Expression Detection using Python

This project detects and classifies human facial expressions in real-time using a webcam and Python. It leverages OpenCV for face detection and a pre-trained deep learning model or `FER` library for emotion recognition.

## ðŸ“Œ Objective

To develop a real-time system that can:
- Detect faces using a webcam
- Classify facial expressions such as Happy, Sad, Angry, Neutral, etc.
- Display the predicted emotion on the live video feed

## ðŸ§  Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV
- FER (Facial Expression Recognition) Library or CNN model
- Haar Cascade Classifier
- TensorFlow / Keras (for custom model training)
- Jupyter Notebook / VS Code
